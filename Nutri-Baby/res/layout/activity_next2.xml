2.Try to ensure that your child eats at least two hot, nutritious meals a day. 

3.Try to give healthy snacks between meals like fresh and dried fruits or raw vegetables, yogurt . Offer your child lots of fresh, safe water to drink between meals to help the body work more efficiently. Offer fruit juices with meals to avoid tooth decay.
4.Avoid un-pasteurized dairy products, soft eggs and under-cooked meat/fish to prevent food poisoning. Don't be tempted to add too much salt and spices as this places an enormous strain on children's' kidneys which have not developed enough to cope.

5.Cut down highly sweetened foods and soft drinks which contain colouring and preservatives. These can cause severe health problems. 

6.Good habits can be established early: Encourage your child to wash their hands before they eat anything

Once a child is malnourished, he/she is more likely to suffer from infections and diseases due to lower body defences. Recovery is likely to take longer. This is called the malnutrition â€“ infection cycle.
2.Many illnesses, including diarrhoea, measles, and respiratory infections can make the effects of malnutrition worse and vice versa. They stop the body from absorbing important nutrients and they also increase the body's need for more nutrients in the diet.
